# PEP Engineering Jest Workshop Labs
Welcome to the 2021 PEP Engineering Jest Workshop!  This repository contains JavaScript code that needs to be tested.  During the lab portion of the workshop, you will add tests to the provided code in an attempt to reach 100% code coverage.  To begin you work, run through the installation below, then create a new branch (using your username or some other unique identifier) on which to add your tests.  Once you push your branch up with your tests added, a GitHub workflow will run that will execute Jest with your tests.
